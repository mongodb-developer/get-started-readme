# Contribute to the Quickstart project 

This page contains information about contributing to Quickstart Docker images.

## Project Structure

### README.md

A `README.md` file to provide information related to the environment. Should include: 
    * Description of repository contents 
    * How to run the project in user's local environment
        * Prerequisites 
        * How to start a Docker image with development prerequisites installed
    * Links to relevant MongoDB Blog Quickstart series posts
    * Links to relevant MongoDB driver reference documentation 
    * Links to MongoDB Atlas free-tier sign-up 

### LICENSE 

A `LICENSE` file for Apache License 2.0 

### Code Examples

Code examples should include: 
    * A working example on how to perform [MongoDB CRUD Operations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)
    * A working example on how to perform [MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/)

Code examples naming convention: 
    * Script name should either be: `Quickstart.ext`, `quickstart.ext` or `quick_start.ext` based on language specific file convention. 

### Dockerfile 

A `Dockerfile` to build a working environment Docker image. Should: 
    * Use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as base
    * Only expose ports that are required by the image
    * Default working directory should be `/home/ubuntu`
    * Keep dependencies minimal ( for size ) 
    * Expose a build `ARG` called `DRIVER_VERSION` to allow an easy way to change the driver version

### Miscellaneous 

For consistency, the Docker environment should have `nano` simple editor installed.
