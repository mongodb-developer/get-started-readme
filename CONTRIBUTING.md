# Contributing to the MongoDB Get-Started project

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Get-Started projects. These are mostly guidelines, not rules.

## Project Goal

The MongoDB Get-Started project helps set up local development environments to run
applications using [official MongoDB drivers](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/).

Each Get-Started repository includes:
 - instructions on how to install prerequisites
 - working code examples demonstrating some basic CRUD (Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete)
   and aggregation commands
 - links to relevant tutorials and documentation from MongoDB

## Project Structure

### README.md

A `README.md` file to provide information related to the environmentL

  * Description of repository contents 
  * How to run the project in user's local environment
      
      * Prerequisites
      * How to start a Docker image with development prerequisites installed
      
  * Links to relevant MongoDB Blog Quick Start series posts (if any)
  * Links to relevant MongoDB driver reference documentation
  * Links to MongoDB Atlas free-tier sign-up

### LICENSE

A `LICENSE` file for Apache License 2.0

### Code Examples

Code examples should include:

  * A working example on how to perform [MongoDB CRUD Operations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/).
  * A working example on how to perform [MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/).

File naming conventions:

  * Script name should be `Getstarted.ext`, `getstarted.ext`, or `get_started.ext` based on language-specific naming conventions.

### Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` to build a working environment Docker image.

This should:

  * Use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as base
  * Only expose ports that are required by the image
  * Use `/home/ubuntu` as the working directory
  * Keep dependencies minimal ( for size )
  * Expose a build `ARG` called `DRIVER_VERSION` to allow an easy way to change the driver version

### Miscellaneous

For consistency, the Docker environment should have `nano` and `vim` editors installed.

## Pull Requests are always welcome

Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Found a bug and know how to fix it? Do it! We will appreciate it.
